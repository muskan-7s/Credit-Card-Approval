# Credit Card Approval Prediction

This project aims to predict credit card approval using machine learning, specifically logistic regression. The dataset contains information such as age, income, and credit score of applicants, along with whether they were approved or not.

## Project Overview

In this project, we will:
- Load and explore the dataset
- Preprocess and prepare the data
- Build a logistic regression model to predict credit card approval
- Evaluate the model using various metrics
- Visualize the data and model performance

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains the following columns:
- `Age`: Age of the applicant
- `Income`: Annual income of the applicant
- `Credit_Score`: Credit score of the applicant
- `Approved`: Whether the applicant's credit card application was approved (1 for approved, 0 for not approved)

You can find the dataset in the `credit_card_approval_large.csv` file.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/credit-card-approval-prediction.git
## Usage
Open the Jupyter Notebook (credit_card_approval.ipynb) in Jupyter or any compatible IDE.

Run the notebook step by step.

Visualizations for data exploration and model evaluation will be displayed.

## Visualizations
The notebook includes various visualizations, including:

Age distribution

Income vs. approval status

Correlation matrix

## Confusion matrix

Model Evaluation
The logistic regression model's performance is evaluated using:

Accuracy score

Classification report

Confusion matrix

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how machine learning can be used for predicting credit card approval. The model can be further improved by exploring additional features, hyperparameter tuning, and other machine learning algorithms.
